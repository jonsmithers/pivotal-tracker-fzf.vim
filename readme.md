```

### Environment Variables 101

You can set environment variables from within vim:

```vim
:let $PIVOTAL_TRACKER_PROJECT_ID='...'
:let $PIVOTAL_TRACKER_TOKEN='...'
```

Or you can set them from the terminal:

```bash
export PIVOTAL_TRACKER_TOKEN=<token>
export PIVOTAL_TRACKER_PROJECT_ID=<id>
vim
```

```bash
PIVOTAL_TRACKER_TOKEN=<token> PIVOTAL_TRACKER_PROJECT_ID=<id> vim
```

Or you can set them automatically with a handy tool such as
[***direnv***](https://direnv.net/) or
[***vim-dotenv***](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dotenv).
